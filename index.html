After an initial rocky period at the Lane, he put in a string of dazzling performances both domestically and in Europe that attracted the attention of clubs across the continent. Real Madrid came calling, and he currently plays for a star studded side with the likes of Ronaldo, Benzema, Khedira, James and Kroos as his teammates.</p>

                    <h1>A legend was always in the Making</h1>
                    <p>Bale went to Whitchurch High School in Cardiff. He continued with good performances in sports, not only in football but in rugby and hockey too. At age of 14 Gareth could run 100 meter sprint in 11.4 seconds. Because of his amazing football skills, the school’s PE teacher, Gwyn Morris, had special rules for Gareth, and that was to play one-touch football and not use his preferred left foot. While at Whitchurch, Bale trained for Southampton’s academy in Bath, although they had some doubts if they should give him a scholarship because of his height.</p>
